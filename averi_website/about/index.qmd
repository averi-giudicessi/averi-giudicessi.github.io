Professional
-------------------------------------------

I am a second-year doctoral student in Clinical Psychology at Boston University, where my research delves into understanding the earliest changes in the brain associated with preclinical Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Additionally, my focus extends to understanding sex differences in neurodegenerative diseases.

Before starting my doctorate, I earned a Master's degree in Neuropsychology from Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla in Puebla, MÃ©xico, and undergraduate at Fordham University.
