## Hello! 👋

My name is Averi Giudicessi and I'm a PhD Student in Clinical Psychology at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) 

🧠 My research interests include understanding sex differences in older adults and how reproductive factors unique to women may be related to higher rates of AD and dementia in women. I use neuroimaging, and cognitive data, and to try and understand some of these questions.

💜💻✨  I'm part of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) global team.

🧶🍳🐶 My hobbies include knitting, cooking, and hanging out with my dog Robbie.
