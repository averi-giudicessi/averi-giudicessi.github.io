Professional
-------------------------------------------
I am a third-year doctoral student in the clinical psychology program at Boston University (BU) co-mentored by Dr. Yakeel Quiroz and Dr. Alice Cronin-Golomb. I completed her bachelor’s degree at Fordham University with a major in Psychology and an MS in Neuropsychology from Benemerita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla. Prior to becoming a student at BU, I worked as a Research Assistant for University of California San Diego. Broadly, her research interests include sex differences in aging populations and how reproductive factors unique to women may be related to higher rates of AD and dementia in women. I was awarded an NINDS F31 grant in 2024 to examine the sex-specific effects on white matter integrity and brain function in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
